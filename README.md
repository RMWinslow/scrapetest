Todo: delete later. I'm testing something with Github actions.


I'd like to see if I'm able to:
1. generate a page from scratch using python during the pages build process.
2. grab data from an rss feed in the process of building that script.


I am currently doing an otherwise senseless update to trigger the github actions again. (I know there is a better way to do things.)

Build script completed successfully but page isn't showing up. Before I fiddle with hidden keys, let's see if rebuilding the site works.
